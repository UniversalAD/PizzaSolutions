                <p class="font-white ad-body">We provide your pizzeria with Free Pizza Magnets! All you have to do is hand a magnet out to each one of your customers with every single order going out your doors, And the best part is... your magnets are provided to you 100% FREE!</p>
                <p class="font-white ad-body">We encourage distributors to keep a small stock of the magnets at the register for dine-in and carry-out customers, in addition to the ones being handed out on delivery orders. Unlike direct mailers, which have a much higher TTT Rate, or Toss To Trash Rate, not one magnet will go to waste with our guaranteed customer connection solution.</p>
                <p class="font-white ad-body">Tip: Offer the magnet at the door. This will reduce the risk of unwanted, wasted magnets and leave more for the customers who use magnets.</p>
